# React Developer Website Template

This template is for developers who wish to host their own website.
I used it to host my own.

For using it, it takes two simple steps:
- Put your personal data in `scr/store/person.tsx` 
- and make entries for your projects in `src/rsc/projects.json`

Then start the page via `yarn start` in Development mode on port 3000 to see if everthings working.
`yarn build` will create a staticly hostable version of the website - deployable virtually everywhere e.g. on github pages.

__Please make sure to keep the "Template by Tristan Ratz" disclaimer on your site.__

You can find a demo of this repo [here.](http://www.tristanratz.com)

Thank you and happy coding.
